  In biology, abiogenesis, or informally the origin of life (OoL), is the natural
  process by which life has arisen from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds.
  While the details of this process are still unknown, the prevailing scientific hypothesis
  is that the transition from non-living to living entities was not a single event, but an
  evolutionary process of increasing complexity that involved molecular self-replication,
  self-assembly, autocatalysis, and the emergence of cell membranes. Although the occurrence
  of abiogenesis is uncontroversial among scientists, its possible mechanisms are poorly
  understood. There are several principles and hypotheses for how abiogenesis could have
  occurred
